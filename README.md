# `panic-persist`

Writes panic messages to a section of RAM

This crate contains an implementation of `panic_fmt` that logs panic messages to a region of
RAM defined by the user, so that these messages can be retrieved on next boot, and handled
outside of panic context, by sending to a logging interface, writing to flash, etc.

After logging the message to RAM, the device will be soft-reset automatically.

Unlike other methods this allows to discover the panic reason post-mortem using normal program
control flow.

Currently this crate was only tested on ARM Cortex-M architecture but should be easily portable
to other platforms as required.

## Usage

### Add a section to your linker script

You will need to reserve a section of RAM to be used to persist messages. This section must be
large enough to hold the 8 byte header, as well as any panic messages you would like to persist.
If there is not suitable space in the section, the panic message will be truncated.

This section should be outside of any other sections, to prevent program initialization from
zeroing or otherwise modifying these sections on boot.

`memory.x` file before modification:

```text
MEMORY
{
  /* NOTE K = KiBi = 1024 bytes */
  FLASH : ORIGIN  = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 512K
  RAM : ORIGIN    = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 64K
}
```

`memory.x` file after modification to hold a 1K region:

```text
MEMORY
{
  /* NOTE K = KiBi = 1024 bytes */
  FLASH : ORIGIN  = 0x00000000, LENGTH = 512K
  RAM : ORIGIN    = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 63K
  PANDUMP: ORIGIN = 0x2000FC00, LENGTH = 1K
}

_panic_dump_start = ORIGIN(PANDUMP);
_panic_dump_end   = ORIGIN(PANDUMP) + LENGTH(PANDUMP);
```


### Program Usage Example

```rust
#![no_std]

use panic_persist as _;

#[entry]
fn main() -> ! {
    // Normal board setup...

    // Check if there was a panic message, if so, send to UART
    if let Some(msg) = get_panic_message_bytes() {
        board.uart.write(msg);
    }

    // ...
}
```

## Features

There are two optional features, `utf8` and `custom-panic-handler`.

### utf8

This allows the panic message to be returned
as a `&str` rather than `&[u8]`, for easier printing. As this requires the ability
to validate the UTF-8 string (to ensure it wasn't truncated mid-character), it may
increase code size usage, and is by default off.

### custom-panic-handler

This disables the panic handler from this library so that any user can implement their own.
To persist panic messages, the function `report_panic_info` is made available;

```rust
// My custom panic implementation
#[panic_handler]
fn panic(info: &PanicInfo) -> ! {
    // ...
    panic_persist::report_panic_info(info);
    // ...
}
```
